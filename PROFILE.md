Description and Meaning of Each Part
Name (CakraSoft):
Cakra: Taken from Sanskrit, "Cakra" means "wheel", "energy center", or "dynamic force". This symbolizes the company's boundless energy in innovation and its role as a central force in the IT field.
Soft: An abbreviation for "Software" or "Solutions", emphasizing the company's primary focus on digital technology and software development.
Symbol (Digital Cakra Icon):
Form: This icon is a modernization of the traditional cakra shape. The firm lines and dynamic form symbolize forward movement and innovation.
Internal Details (Circuitry & Connection Points): The subtle details within the cakra blades represent data pathways and nodes (points). This symbolizes CakraSoft's workflow: The "Points" are the specific inputs or client requests, and the "Circuitry" is CakraSoft's process of connecting all these inputs into one functional and customized system.
Color Palette:
Deep Purple / Blue-Purple Gradient: Symbolizes wisdom, creativity, and luxury. This indicates that the developed solutions are premium and crafted with deep thought.
Gold / Golden Yellow (At the Core): Symbolizes superior quality, success, and the high value of the final solution delivered to clients. It also radiates the energy of innovation from the "Cakra" center.
Black / Dark Gray (On Text): Symbolizes professionalism, authority, strength, and a solid foundation.
